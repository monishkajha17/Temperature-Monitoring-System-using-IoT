# Temperature-Monitoring-System-using-IoT
<h2>AGENDA<h2>
  <p>It is very important in pharmaceutical industry to maintain the temperature of the medicines in the threshold range and it's very important to inform the owner if the temperature is about to go beyond the set threshold value, my IDEA does exactly the work of saving lot of products from damaging by informing to owner even before the temperature reaches beyond the threshold value set.

</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this IDEA we gonna to make a temperature monitoring system where it gonna to sense temperature in pharmaceutical industry; because certain medicines need a definite temperature to be manufactured if the temperature fluctuates the medicine can be poisonous.</p>
  <p>So it will sense the fluctuation of temperature and will report it to the user by message:

  <li>Message notification on Phone.</li>
