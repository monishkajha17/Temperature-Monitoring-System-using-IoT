# Temperature-Monitoring-System-using-IoT
<h2>AGENDA<h2>
  <p>Temperature plays a crucial role in our day-to-day life for maintaining our health as well as in various dominant industries. Fluctuation or change in temperature can cause various physical and chemical effects on substances.That's why we need to maintain temperature for many vital processes to ensure consistency and safety.In many industries it is very important to maintain temperature in the threshold range and to inform the owner if the temperature is about to go beyond the set threshold value,by avoiding damaging to lots of product before the temperature reaches beyond set threshold value set. The Temperature monitoring system can be used in Pharmaeutical industry, in Laboratories, Food Safety Compliances and remote Warehouses.

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. The Internet of Things technology has been growing rapidly and has already bypassed conventional systems in terms of features and functionalities.By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.</p>

 IoT applications use machine learning algorithms to analyze massive amounts of connected sensor data in the cloud. Using real-time IoT dashboards and alerts, you gain visibility into key performance indicators, statistics for mean time between failures, and other information. Machine learning–based algorithms can identify equipment anomalies and send alerts to users and even trigger automated fixes or proactive counter measures.

Its applications in the field of remote monitoring and advanced analytics are revolutionizing businesses and are offering exemplary benefits to them.One such application of IoT is temperature monitoring. A temperature monitoring solution is immensely beneficial to industries where temperature plays a crucial role in defining the quality of the products. Moreover, in a cold chain, a temperature monitoring solution allow a logistic manager to monitor the temperature of the item  real-time.
