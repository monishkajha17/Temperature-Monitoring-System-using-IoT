# Temperature-Monitoring-System-using-IoT
<h2>AGENDA<h2>
  <p>Temperature plays a crucial role in our day-to-day life for maintaining our health as well as in various dominant industries. Fluctuation or change in temperature can cause various physical and chemical effects on substances.That's why we need to maintain temperature for many vital processes to ensure consistency and safety.In many industries it is very important to maintain temperature in the threshold range and to inform the owner if the temperature is about to go beyond the set threshold value,by avoiding damaging to lots of product before the temperature reaches beyond set threshold value set. The Temperature monitoring system can be used in Pharmaeutical industry, in Laboratories, Food Safety Compliances and remote Warehouses.

<p>In this IDEA we gonna to make a temperature monitoring system where it gonna to sense temperature in pharmaceutical industry; because certain medicines need a definite temperature to be manufactured if the temperature fluctuates the medicine can be poisonous.</p>
  <p>So it will sense the fluctuation of temperature and will report it to the user by message:

  <li>Message notification on Whatsapp.</li>
  <li>Message notification on Telegram.</li>
  <li>Message notification on Phone.</li>
  </ol>
